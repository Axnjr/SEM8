## 3. Social Media Text, Action & Hyperlink Analytics

### Social Media Text Analytics

Text analytics, often referred to as text mining, is a sophisticated process that involves extracting valuable and actionable insights from unstructured text data prevalent on social media platforms. This process is crucial because social media is a rich source of textual data, including posts, comments, tweets, and captions, which are generated by users in real-time. The primary goal of text analytics is to transform this vast amount of raw text into structured information that can be analyzed to understand various aspects such as public sentiment, emerging trends, and user behavior.

The process of text analytics involves several key steps. Initially, it requires the collection of text data from various social media platforms, which can be achieved through APIs, social listening tools, or web scraping, while ensuring ethical considerations are met. Once the data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing, where the text is cleaned by removing irrelevant elements like special characters, emojis, and URLs, and is then prepared for analysis through techniques such as tokenization and lemmatization.

After preprocessing, the text is converted into a numerical format using methods like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or advanced word embeddings such as Word2Vec and BERT, which allow for more nuanced analysis. Finally, various analytical techniques are applied to the structured data to extract insights. These techniques can include sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion, trend detection to identify viral topics, and brand monitoring to understand how a brand is perceived by the public. Through these detailed processes, text analytics provides organizations with the ability to make informed decisions based on the rich, unstructured data available on social media platforms.

Since much of the data on social media is in the form of text (posts, comments, tweets, captions, etc.), text analytics is crucial for understanding public opinion, trends, sentiments, and behaviors.

# 1. Collaborative-based recommendation: 
also known as collaborative filtering, is a popular technique used in recommender systems to suggest items to users based on the preferences and behaviors of other users. 

### Types of Collaborative Filtering: 

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
This method finds users who are similar to the target user and recommends items that those similar users have liked. ex: If User A and User B both liked movies X and Y, and User B also liked movie Z, then movie Z is recommended to User A.

- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
This method finds items that are similar to the items the target user has liked and recommends those similar items. ex: If User A liked movies X and Y, and movie Z is similar to movie X, then movie Z is recommended to User A.

### Steps Involved

- **Data Collection**:
Collect data on user interactions with items, such as ratings, purchases, or clicks.

- **Similarity Calculation**:
Calculate the similarity between users or items using metrics like cosine 
similarity, Pearson correlation, or Jaccard index.
- **Prediction**:
Predict the rating or preference a user might have for an item based on the 
similarities calculated.
- **Recommendation**:
Recommend the top-N items with the highest predicted ratings or preferences to the 
user.

# 2. Social Information Filtering:
refers to the `process of using social data such as likes, shares, comments, and user behavior to filter and recommend content.` It plays a central role in social media analytics, helping platforms personalize user experiences and extract insights from large volumes of user-generated content. Social Information Filtering uses the `behavior and preferences of users within a network to recommend content to others`. It is a `subtype of collaborative filtering`, where user interactions serve as implicit feedback. `Social Information Filtering (SIF) is a type of recommendation system that suggests items to users based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users within a social network.` `It leverages the idea that people's tastes and interests are often influenced by the tastes and preferences of those around them.` Essentially, SIF automates the process of "word-of-mouth" recommendations by analyzing the collective preferences of many users to personalize suggestions for each individual

### 🔹 Social Sharing in Social Media Analytics
Social sharing is the act of distributing content through social networks. It is a major signal in filtering and recommendation algorithms.

### Key Aspects:

- Virality Tracking: Analyzing how content spreads and identifying key influencers.
- Engagement Metrics: Shares are stronger signals of interest than views or likes.
- Topic Trends: Content with high sharing metrics often contributes to trending topics.
- Audience Segmentation: Understanding who shares what, and with whom, helps in clustering users for targeting or personalization.

### Example:
A tweet shared widely by tech influencers will likely surface in other users’ feeds—even if they don’t follow the original poster—due to social filtering algorithms that interpret shares as a strong positive signal.

# 3. Social media risk management: 

involves a structured approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating, and evaluating risks associated with social media usage. Here are the four key steps:

- Identify Risks – Recognizing potential threats such as reputational damage, security breaches, misinformation, and compliance violations.
